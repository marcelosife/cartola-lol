# Personal React Project 

Personal project to test my knowledge of Reactjs and put into practice an app idea. The idea of this project is similar to the project @CartolaFC, but it's for League of Legends Championships. Here the user can create your own League of Legends team picking real pro players and obtain points based on the current real championship results.
